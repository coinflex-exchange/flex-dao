# MockOneSplitAudit

This is a deployment that mocks basic functionality of 1Inch's OneSplitAudit contract deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. It serves only one function when deployed which is informing the price pre-swapped and facilitating swap for the GaugeProxy. In this demo/mock contract, it assumes that only StableSwapFLEX is available.

## MockOneSplitAudit: Parameters - n/a

## MockOneSplitAudit: TODO - depending on chain selected, adopt 1Inchâ€™s equivalent contracts or implement Oracle
